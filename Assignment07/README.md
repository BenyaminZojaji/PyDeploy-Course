## Async IO in Python
- In this exercise, I defined async functions using the AsyncIO library.

### Async API
In this assignment, I Wrote a function for using an API[^1] to get a word and return its rhymes while there is another function to use an API[^2] and return a list of states of Iran and a list of cities of specific state.

usage:
```
python async_api.py
```

[^1]:<a href='https://rhyming.ir/'>Rhyming</a>
[^2]:<a href='https://iran-locations-api.ir/'>Iran Locations API</a>
